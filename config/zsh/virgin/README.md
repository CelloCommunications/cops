# Virgin macOS Shell Configs

This directory contains the default shell configuration files from a fresh macOS system, captured using GitHub Actions runners.

These files serve as reference points to:

- Compare against your current configuration
- See what the original macOS defaults were
- Understand what customizations COPS has added

Files:

- `zshrc`: Default system-wide zshrc from /private/etc/zshrc
- `.config/`: Complete default .config directory structure from a fresh macOS install
