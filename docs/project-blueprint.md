## Current Development Focus

### 1. Core System Enhancements

#### Configuration Management

- Schema validation
- Environment variable validation
- Configuration inheritance
- Override capabilities
- Documentation generation

#### Installation System

> most of this is heavily dependant of brew, the features below would come into play for manual installations

- Installation queuing
- Parallel installation
- Retry logic
- Error reporting
- Dependency resolution

#### System Validation

- Compatibility checks
- Version verification
- Resource validation
- State monitoring
- Network validation

### 2. New Module Development

#### MCP Integration

- Server management
- Client configuration
- Tool integration
- Resource handling

#### Update System

- Software update integration
- Brew update management
- Update scheduling
- Version control

#### VSCode Configuration

- Extension management
- Settings configuration
- Keybindings setup
- Snippet management
- Theme installation

## Technical Requirements

### Module Structure

- Maximum 300 lines per module

## Technical Notes

### Architecture Decisions

- Single source of truth (config.yaml)
- Modular design
- Safety-first approach
- Clear separation of concerns

### Implementation Guidelines

- Shell script standards compliance
- Comprehensive error handling
- Consistent logging
- Thorough documentation

>Just in case didn't catch it: - shellcheck compliance at every step!

### Development Process

- Test-driven development
- Regular code review
- Performance monitoring
- Security validation
